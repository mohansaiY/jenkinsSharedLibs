//Starting with Declarative 1.2, released in late September, 2017, you can define Declarative Pipelines in your shared libraries as well. Here’s an example, which will execute a different Declarative Pipeline depending on whether the build number is odd or even:

// vars/evenOrOdd.groovy
def call(int buildNumber) {
  if (buildNumber % 2 == 0) {
    pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
        stage('Even Stage') {
          steps {
            echo "The build number is even"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  } else {
    pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
        stage('Odd Stage') {
          steps {
            echo "The build number is odd"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
